Junior Year Academic Project 300

Full Description:
The first phase of this proejct was to collect data from facebook using graph api. We used an online quiz to draw attention and get permission to download individual's public data from their facebook profile. The collector folder contains the source code of the website we used for the online quiz. User's public data was saved in a NoSQL database in the server side using MongoDB. 
The second Phase of this project was to analyze user's public data to find a pattern in their writings - about me, description, public posts, comments etc. The details about the second phase will be added later.
